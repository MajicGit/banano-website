		In the year 2009, we saw the introduction of the first ever decentralized payment network, the
		mother of all coins, Bitcoin [1]. In the years that followed, global interest grew and Bitcoin
		inspired the genesis of numerous cryptography based projects that also worked towards trustless
		secure payment systems and storage of value.
		<br /><br />
		Bitcoin uses blockchain technology where a distributed ledger records transactions chronologically
		and publicly. Subsequent advancement in the space gave rise to second generation projects like Ethereum,
		Litecoin, EOS, Stellar, Monero and many others, which built on this concept by adding new features,
		and sometimes by acting as platforms for dApps - the execution of decentralised applications. Then
		finally in 2015, Sergio Lerner published a paper describing the applicability of so-called Directed
		Acyclic Graphs (DAG) to the field of cryptography [2]. This concept was adopted by multiple third
		generation cryptocurrencies. One such project originally developed by Colin LeMahieu emerged by specifically
		targeting the scalability issues plaguing generations one and two: Raiblocks. Raiblocks rebranded
		to NANO in January 2018 [3].
		<br /><br />
		BANANO is a feeless, instant, rich in potassium cryptocurrency powered by DAG technology disrupting
		the meme economy. It is the first fork peel of NANO, the genesis block redefining the memeconomy
		on 1 April 2018. Oh, did you know that Colin Lemahieu, the founder of Nano, likes us? Yea, thatâ€™s
		right (Figure 1)!
